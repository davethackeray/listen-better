Sick of the same shit on Spotify?
Can't be bothered waiting for Discover Weekly - and hate it, anyway?

Run this Python script and get Gemini recommending a better way to listen - with 20 carefully curated tunes based on your Liked Songs playlist.
Every day, if you like. Heck, run a cron job! What a way to wake up!

1. Go grab your Spotify dev keys, and create an account at Google AI Studio. I'm rocking the latest FREE model - so fill your boots.
2. In your terminal, run this command: pip install google-generativeai OR if you have done this in the past, make sure you have the up-to-date version by running: pip install --upgrade google-generativeai
3. Run this magical frickin' Python code.
4. You should get all your 20 recommendations lined up in a playlist called AI Deep Cuts. Ready to blow your frickin' mind!
